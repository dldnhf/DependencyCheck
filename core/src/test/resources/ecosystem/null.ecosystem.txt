The kernel in Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not properly load structured exception handling tables, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass the SafeSEH security feature by leveraging a Visual C++ .NET 2003 application, aka "Windows Kernel SafeSEH Bypass Vulnerability."
TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 devices, as well as Novo, CeNova, QSee, Pulnix, XVR 5 in 1, Securus, Night OWL, DVR Login, HVR Login, and MDVR Login, which run re-branded versions of the original TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 series, allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via a "Cookie: uid=admin" header, as demonstrated by a device.rsp?opt=user&cmd=list request that provides credentials within JSON data in a response.
