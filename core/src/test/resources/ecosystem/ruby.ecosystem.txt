The sqlite3-ruby gem in the rubygem-sqlite3 package before 1.2.4-0.5.1 in SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 11 SP1 uses weak permissions for unspecified files, which allows local users to gain privileges via unknown vectors.
lib/rack/multipart.rb in Rack before 1.1.4, 1.2.x before 1.2.6, 1.3.x before 1.3.7, and 1.4.x before 1.4.2 uses an incorrect regular expression, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted Content-Disposion header.
