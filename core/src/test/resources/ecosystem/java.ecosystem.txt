The UnhandledDataStructure function in hwpf/model/UnhandledDataStructure.java in Apache POI 3.8 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (OutOfMemoryError exception and possibly JVM destabilization) via a crafted length value in a Channel Definition Format (CDF) or Compound File Binary Format (CFBF) document.
VMware SpringSource Grails before 1.3.8, and 2.x before 2.0.2, does not properly restrict data binding, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and modify arbitrary object properties via a crafted request parameter to an application.
IBM Rational ClearQuest 7.1.x through 7.1.2.7 and 8.x through 8.0.0.3 allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via a request to a (1) snoop, (2) hello, (3) ivt/, (4) hitcount, (5) HitCount.jsp, (6) HelloHTMLError.jsp, (7) HelloHTML.jsp, (8) HelloVXMLError.jsp, (9) HelloVXML.jsp, (10) HelloWMLError.jsp, (11) HelloWML.jsp, or (12) cqweb/j_security_check sample script.
Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Sound). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u201, 7u191 and 8u182; Java SE Embedded: 8u181; JRockit: R28.3.19. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g. through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
