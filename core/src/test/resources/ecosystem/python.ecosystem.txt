libs/updater.py in GoLismero 0.6.3, and other versions before Git revision 2b3bb43d6867, as used in backtrack and possibly other products, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on GoLismero-controlled files, as demonstrated using Admin/changes.dat.
The (1) django.http.HttpResponseRedirect and (2) django.http.HttpResponsePermanentRedirect classes in Django before 1.3.2 and 1.4.x before 1.4.1 do not validate the scheme of a redirect target, which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a data: URL.
