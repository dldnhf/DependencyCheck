Heap-based buffer overflow in the process_tx_desc function in the e1000 emulation (hw/e1000.c) in qemu-kvm 0.12, and possibly other versions, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (QEMU crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted legacy mode packets.
Integer overflow in the xfs_acl_from_disk function in fs/xfs/xfs_acl.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1.9 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a filesystem with a malformed ACL, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
The log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.17 through 2.2.21, when a threaded MPM is used, does not properly handle a %{}C format string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a cookie that lacks both a name and a value.
The CBounceDCCMod::OnPrivCTCP function in bouncedcc.cpp in the bouncedcc module in ZNC 0.200 and 0.202 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted DCC RESUME request.
Integer overflow in the GnashImage::size method in libbase/GnashImage.h in GNU Gnash 0.8.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SWF file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
